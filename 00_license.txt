This paper explains the "Precision Limit" of resolution that is 
evaluated by the rainSTORM software. Referencing it will also 
acknowledge the main authors of the software. 


Note for general interest that the "rain" prefix of rainSTORM is not a
particular acronynm. It is simply a name to assist file organisation.
